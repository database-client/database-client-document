## About Pay

I have explained the reason for switching to payment, which is for my benefit. But this is not to punish silent users, I will now put more effort into developing this extension, you can get a better experience. 

If there has been no financial support, the project will eventually end of life. But not anymore, thanks to paid users.

## About Name

In the beginning, this extension only supported mysql, now mysql still has the most users, so the name is still kept as mysql, and at the same time I released an extension with a new name, and the two extensions will be updated synchronously.
